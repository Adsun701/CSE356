# cse356_milestone1_project

For this cloud computing project, I implemented a CRDT-based (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type) editor, which can make changes to text that will be reflected from other instances of the editor. Knowledge of the Model-View-Controller setup, in addition to routes and functions to handle the CRDT data, was required in order to complete this project successfully.
